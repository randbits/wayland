NOTE: the following are not necessarily true for wayland now.

#basic architecture
1. server create server-side display object.
   the display object has the object id: 0 and 
   implements display_interface.
   add to the server side object list: wl_hash.
2. server add the listening socket to event loop.
4. server side main loop runs.
5. client connects to wayland.
6. @sock_data get called.
   the callback @socket_data create clients and 
   add the corresponding socket fd to event loop
   with callback @wl_client_data.
7. client send a message to wayland.
   marshalling function and parameters to the wire 
   format.
8. server invokes @wl_client_data
   lookup the object whose interface contains the method
   by the object id.
   demarshalling function and parameters from the wire.
   invoke the function with the specified parameters.

most of the time we need to explicitly request some object
be created on the server with a given new_id.
